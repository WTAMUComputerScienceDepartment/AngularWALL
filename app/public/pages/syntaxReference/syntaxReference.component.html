    <h1>WALL (WTAMU AssembLy Language) Syntax</h1>
    <h2>WALL Syntax Structure</h2>
    <p>
        [label:] [instruction] [# comment]
    </p>
    <p>
        The above line is the syntactical structure for every line of code
        written in WALL.<br>
        Note: The brackets denote that the content is optional.
        Even though each portion is optional, the order is not.<br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            A line begins with an optional label, that is delimited by a colon.<br>
            Note: Labels ARE case sensitive.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            The next part of the line is an Operation or Pseudo-Op,followed by
            its arguments.<br>
            Note: Instructions and arguments are NOT case sensitive.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally a line can end in an optional comment. (Anything that comes
            after the comment symbol "#" is treated as a comment, even labels and
            instructions.)<br>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Reserved Words</h2>
    <p>
        These are characters and words that are used by WALL to Parse and interpret
        the code input into the Text Editor. Therefore using them as a label or a
        EQU label may cause unpredictable errors in the Assembler.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Register Names(R0-RF) - overloading these names can confuse the parser</li>
        <li>Operation Names - overloading these names can confuse the parser</li>
        <li>Pseudo-Op Names - overloading these names can confuse the parser</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Valid Labels</h2>
    <p>
        A valid label consists of underscores(_) and Alphanumerics and is
        case sensitive.<br>
        Note: a label can not be a reserved word, all numerics, or hex values
        indicated by "0x" or "0X".
    </p>
    <h2>WALL has 16 Registers.</h2>
    <p>
        Registers are used as a form of "lag free" memory to store data
        temporarily as it is being manipulated.<br>
        Most of these are general purpose, and have no special uses, but
        the following have special purposes.<br>

    <h2>Operations</h2>
    <p>
        Operations are Instructions and their arguments. Each instruction
        has its own specific argument structure. All instructions compile
        into their Op-Code format and are stored into memory for execution.<br>
        Note: All Instructions are 2 Bytes long.
    </p>

    <h2>Pseudo-Ops</h2>
    <p>
        Pseudo-Ops are similar to Operations, except that they do not compile
        as code directly into memory. Instead, they act as a kind of marker
        that tell the Assembler how to handle some kinds of associations and data.<br>
